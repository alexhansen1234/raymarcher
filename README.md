Start of a raymarcher

Build with commands
	
		cd src
		cmake .
		make

Run Target Binary with commands
	
		cd ../build
		./raymarcher

Output is a PPM format image, which can be opened in any decent preview software.

To-do:
Out-of-source build to keep CMake build files under control, and out of source repo.
